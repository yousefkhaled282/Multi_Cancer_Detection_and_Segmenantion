# Title: Multi Cancer Detection and Segmentation using Computer Vision
# Description:
  This project is a computer vision application that uses deep learning algorithms to classify, detect, and segment cancer in brain and breast images.
  The application first classifies brain and breast images, then detects the presence of tumors in brain images. 
  For tumors detected in brain images, the application uses the U-Net segmentation model to accurately segment the tumor region. In breast images,
  the application detects whether the cancer is benign, malignant, or normal, and then calculates the size of any tumors present. 
  The project aims to improve cancer diagnosis accuracy and treatment by providing an automated tool for detecting and segmenting tumors in medical images.
